    <title>Examples</title>
    <para>The HornetQ distribution comes with over 70 run out-of-the-box examples demonstrating many
        of the features.</para>
    <para>The examples are available in the distribution, in the <literal>examples</literal>
        directory. Examples are split into JMS and core examples. JMS examples show how a particular
        feature can be used by a normal JMS client. Core examples show how the equivalent feature
        can be used by a core messaging client.</para>
    <para>A set of Java EE examples are also provided which need the JBoss Application Server
        installed to be able to run.</para>
    <section>
        <title>JMS Examples</title>
        <para>To run a JMS example, simply <literal>cd</literal> into the appropriate example
            directory and type <literal>mvn verify</literal> (For details please read the readme.html
            in each example directory).</para>
        <para>Here's a listing of the examples with a brief description.</para>
        <section id="examples.aerogear">
            <title>JMS AeroGear</title>
            <para>This example shows how you can send a message to a mobile device by leveraging 
            AeroGears push technology which provides support for different push notification technologies
            like Google Cloud Messaging, Apple's APNs or Mozilla's SimplePush.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.applet">
            <title>Applet</title>
            <para>This example shows you how to send and receive JMS messages from an Applet.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="application-level-failover">
            <title>Application-Layer Failover</title>
            <para>HornetQ also supports Application-Layer failover, useful in the case that
                replication is not enabled on the server side.</para>
            <para>With Application-Layer failover, it's up to the application to register a JMS
                    <literal>ExceptionListener</literal> with HornetQ which will be called by
                HornetQ in the event that connection failure is detected.</para>
            <para>The code in the <literal>ExceptionListener</literal> then recreates the JMS
                connection, session, etc on another node and the application can continue.</para>
            <para>Application-layer failover is an alternative approach to High Availability (HA).
                Application-layer failover differs from automatic failover in that some client side
                coding is required in order to implement this. Also, with Application-layer
                failover, since the old session object dies and a new one is created, any
                uncommitted work in the old session will be lost, and any unacknowledged messages
                might be redelivered.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.bridge">
            <title>Core Bridge Example</title>
            <para>The <literal>bridge</literal> example demonstrates a core bridge deployed on one
                server, which consumes messages from a local queue and forwards them to an address
                on a second server.</para>
            <para>Core bridges are used to create message flows between any two HornetQ servers
                which are remotely separated. Core bridges are resilient and will cope with
                temporary connection failure allowing them to be an ideal choice for forwarding over
                unreliable connections, e.g. a WAN.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.browsers">
            <title>Browser</title>
            <para>The <literal>browser</literal> example shows you how to use a JMS <literal
                    >QueueBrowser</literal> with HornetQ.</para>
            <para>Queues are a standard part of JMS, please consult the JMS 1.1 specification for
                full details.</para>
            <para> A <literal>QueueBrowser</literal> is used to look at messages on the queue
                without removing them. It can scan the entire content of a queue or only messages
                matching a message selector.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Client Kickoff</title>
            <para>The <literal>client-kickoff</literal> example shows how to terminate client
                connections given an IP address using the JMX management API.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Client side failover listener</title>
            <para>The <literal>client-side-failoverlistener</literal> example shows how to register a listener to monitor
            failover events</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Client-Side Load-Balancing</title>
            <para>The <literal>client-side-load-balancing</literal> example demonstrates how
                sessions created from a single JMS <literal>Connection</literal> can
                be created to different nodes of the cluster. In other words it demonstrates how
                HornetQ does client-side load-balancing of sessions across the cluster.</para>

            <para>This example demonstrates a clustered JMS durable subscription</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.clustered.grouping">
            <title>Clustered Grouping</title>
            <para>This is similar to the message grouping example except that it demonstrates it
                working over a cluster. Messages sent to different nodes with the same group id will
                be sent to the same node and the same consumer.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.clustered.queue">
            <title>Clustered Queue</title>
            <para>The <literal>clustered-queue</literal> example demonstrates a JMS queue deployed
                on two different nodes. The two nodes are configured to form a cluster. We then
                create a consumer for the queue on each node, and we create a producer on only one
                of the nodes. We then send some messages via the producer, and we verify that both
                consumers receive the sent messages in a round-robin fashion.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.clustered.jgroups">
            <title>Clustering with JGroups</title>
            <para>The <literal>clustered-jgroups</literal> example demonstrates how to form a two
                node cluster using JGroups as its underlying topology discovery technique, rather than
                the default UDP broadcasting. We then create a consumer for the queue on each node, 
                and we create a producer on only one of the nodes. We then send some messages via the
                producer, and we verify that both consumers receive the sent messages in a round-robin fashion.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.clustered.standalone">
            <title>Clustered Standalone</title>
            <para>The <literal>clustered-standalone</literal> example demonstrates how to configure
                and starts 3 cluster nodes on the same machine to form a cluster. A subscriber for a
                JMS topic is created on each node, and we create a producer on only one of the
                nodes. We then send some messages via the producer, and we verify that the 3
                subscribers receive all the sent messages.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.clustered.static.discovery">
            <title>Clustered Static Discovery</title>
            <para>This example demonstrates how to configure a cluster using a list of connectors rather
               than UDP for discovery</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.clustered.static.oneway">
            <title>Clustered Static Cluster One Way</title>
            <para>This example demonstrates how to set up a cluster where cluster connections are one way,
            i.e. server A -> Server B -> Server C</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Clustered Topic</title>
            <para>The <literal>clustered-topic</literal> example demonstrates a JMS topic deployed
                on two different nodes. The two nodes are configured to form a cluster. We then
                create a subscriber on the topic on each node, and we create a producer on only one
                of the nodes. We then send some messages via the producer, and we verify that both
                subscribers receive all the sent messages.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.consumer-rate-limit">
            <title>Message Consumer Rate Limiting</title>
            <para>With HornetQ you can specify a maximum consume rate at which a JMS MessageConsumer
                will consume messages. This can be specified when creating or deploying the
                connection factory.</para>
            <para>If this value is specified then HornetQ will ensure that messages are never
                consumed at a rate higher than the specified rate. This is a form of consumer
                throttling.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.dead-letter">
            <title>Dead Letter</title>
            <para>The <literal>dead-letter</literal> example shows you how to define and deal with
                dead letter messages. Messages can be delivered unsuccessfully (e.g. if the
                transacted session used to consume them is rolled back). </para>
            <para>Such a message goes back to the JMS destination ready to be redelivered. However,
                this means it is possible for a message to be delivered again and again without any
                success and remain in the destination, clogging the system.</para>
            <para>To prevent this, messaging systems define dead letter messages: after a specified
                unsuccessful delivery attempts, the message is removed from the destination and put
                instead in a dead letter destination where they can be consumed for further
                investigation.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.delayed-redelivery">
            <title>Delayed Redelivery</title>
            <para>The <literal>delayed-redelivery</literal> example demonstrates how HornetQ can be
                configured to provide a delayed redelivery in the case a message needs to be
                redelivered.</para>
            <para>Delaying redelivery can often be useful in the case that clients regularly fail or
                roll-back. Without a delayed redelivery, the system can get into a "thrashing"
                state, with delivery being attempted, the client rolling back, and delivery being
                re-attempted in quick succession, using up valuable CPU and network
                resources.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="divert-example">
            <title>Divert</title>
            <para>HornetQ diverts allow messages to be transparently "diverted" or copied from one
                address to another with just some simple configuration defined on the server
                side.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Durable Subscription</title>
            <para>The <literal>durable-subscription</literal> example shows you how to use a durable
                subscription with HornetQ. Durable subscriptions are a standard part of JMS, please
                consult the JMS 1.1 specification for full details.</para>
            <para>Unlike non-durable subscriptions, the key function of durable subscriptions is
                that the messages contained in them persist longer than the lifetime of the
                subscriber - i.e. they will accumulate messages sent to the topic even if there is
                no active subscriber on them. They will also survive server restarts or crashes.
                Note that for the messages to be persisted, the messages sent to them must be marked
                as durable messages. </para>

        <section id="examples.embedded.jms">
            <title>Embedded</title>
            <para>The <literal>embedded</literal> example shows how to embed JMS
                within your own code using POJO instantiation and no config files.</para>

        <section id="examples.embedded.jms.simple">
            <title>Embedded Simple</title>
            <para>The <literal>embedded</literal> example shows how to embed JMS within your own code using regular HornetQ XML files.</para>

        <section id="examples.expiry">
            <title>Message Expiration</title>
            <para>The <literal>expiry</literal> example shows you how to define and deal with
                message expiration. Messages can be retained in the messaging system for a limited
                period of time before being removed. JMS specification states that clients should
                not receive messages that have been expired (but it does not guarantee this will not
                happen).</para>
            <para>HornetQ can assign an expiry address to a given queue so that when messages
                are expired, they are removed from the queue and sent to the expiry address.
                These "expired" messages can later be consumed from the expiry address for
                further inspection.</para>

        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Instantiate JMS Objects Directly</title>
            <para>Usually, JMS Objects such as <literal>ConnectionFactory</literal>, <literal
                    >Queue</literal> and <literal>Topic</literal> instances are looked up from JNDI
                before being used by the client code. This objects are called "administered objects"
                in JMS terminology.</para>
            <para>However, in some cases a JNDI server may not be available or desired. To come to
                the rescue HornetQ also supports the direct instantiation of these administered
                objects on the client side so you don't have to use JNDI for JMS.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.interceptor">
            <title>Interceptor</title>
            <para>HornetQ allows an application to use an interceptor to hook into the messaging
                system. Interceptors allow you to handle various message events in HornetQ.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.jaas">
            <title>JAAS</title>
            <para>The <literal>jaas</literal> example shows you how to configure HornetQ to use JAAS
                for security. HornetQ can leverage JAAS to delegate user authentication and
                authorization to existing security infrastructure.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.jms.auto-closeable">
            <title>JMS Auto Closable</title>
            <para>The <literal>jms-auto-closeable</literal> example shows how JMS resources, such
            as connections, sessions and consumers, in JMS 2 can be automatically closed on error.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.jms.completion-listener">
            <title>JMS Completion Listener</title>
            <para>The <literal>jms-completion-listener</literal> example shows how to send a message

            <title>JMS Context</title>
            <para>The <literal>jms-context</literal> example shows how to send and receive a message
            to a JMS Queue using HornetQ by using a JMS Context.</para>
            <para>A JMSContext is part of JMS 2.0 and combines the JMS Connection and Session Objects
            into a simple Interface.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.jms.jms-shared-consumer">
            <title>JMS Shared Consumer</title>
            <para>The <literal>jms-shared-consumer</literal> example shows you how can use shared
            consumers to share a subscription on a topic. In JMS 1.1 this was not allowed and so caused
            a scalability issue. In JMS 2 this restriction has been lifted so you can share the load
            across different threads and connections.</para>

        <section id="examples.large-message">
            <title>Large Message</title>
            <para>The <literal>large-message</literal> example shows you how to send and receive
                very large messages with HornetQ. HornetQ supports the sending and receiving of huge
                messages, much larger than can fit in available RAM on the client or server.
                Effectively the only limit to message size is the amount of disk space you have on
                the server.</para>
            <para>Large messages are persisted on the server so they can survive a server restart.
                In other words HornetQ doesn't just do a simple socket stream from the sender to the
                consumer.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="examples.last-value-queue">
            <title>Last-Value Queue</title>
            <para>The <literal>last-value-queue</literal> example shows you how to define and deal
                with last-value queues. Last-value queues are special queues which discard any
                messages when a newer message with the same value for a well-defined last-value
                property is put in the queue. In other words, a last-value queue only retains the

            <para>By default, HornetQ consumers buffer messages from the server in a client side
                buffer before you actually receive them on the client side. This improves
                performance since otherwise every time you called receive() or had processed the
                last message in a <literal>MessageListener onMessage()</literal> method, the HornetQ
                client would have to go the server to request the next message, which would then get
                sent to the client side, if one was available.</para>
            <para>This would involve a network round trip for every message and reduce performance.
                Therefore, by default, HornetQ pre-fetches messages into a buffer on each
                consumer.</para>
            <para>In some case buffering is not desirable, and HornetQ allows it to be switched off.

            <para>HornetQ implements failover of client connections between
