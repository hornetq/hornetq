    <section>
        <title>Clusters Overview</title>
        <para>HornetQ clusters allow groups of HornetQ servers to be grouped together in order to
            share message processing load. Each active node in the cluster is an active HornetQ
            server which manages its own messages and handles its own connections. </para>
        <note id="clustered-deprecation">
            <para> The <emphasis>clustered</emphasis> parameter is deprecated and no longer needed for
            setting up a cluster.</para>
        </note>
        <para>The cluster is formed by each node declaring <emphasis>cluster connections</emphasis>
            to other nodes in the core configuration file <literal
                    >hornetq-configuration.xml</literal>. When a node forms a cluster connection to
            another node, internally it creates a <emphasis>core bridge</emphasis> (as described in
            <xref linkend="core-bridges"/>) connection between it and the other node, this is
            done transparently behind the scenes - you don't have to declare an explicit bridge for
            each node. These cluster connections allow messages to flow between the nodes of the
            cluster to balance load.</para>
        <para>Nodes can be connected together to form a cluster in many different topologies, we
            will discuss a couple of the more common topologies later in this chapter.</para>
        <para>We'll also discuss client side load balancing, where we can balance client connections
            across the nodes of the cluster, and we'll consider message redistribution where HornetQ
            will redistribute messages between nodes to avoid starvation.</para>
        <para>Another important part of clustering is <emphasis>server discovery</emphasis> where
            servers can broadcast their connection details so clients or other servers can connect
            to them with the minimum of configuration.</para>
        <warning id="copy-warning">
            <para>Once a cluster node has been configured it is common to simply copy that configuration
            to other nodes to produce a symmetric cluster. However, care must be taken when copying the
            HornetQ files. Do not copy the HornetQ <emphasis>data</emphasis> (i.e. the
            <literal>bindings</literal>, <literal>journal</literal>, and <literal>large-messages</literal>
            directories) from one node to another. When a node is started for the first time and initializes
            its journal files it also persists a special identifier to the <literal>journal</literal>
            directory. This id <emphasis>must</emphasis> be unique among nodes in the cluster or the
            cluster will not form properly.</para>

        <title>Server discovery</title>
        <para>Server discovery is a mechanism by which servers can propagate their connection details to:</para>

                <para>
                    Messaging clients. A messaging client wants to be able to connect
                    to the servers of the cluster without having specific knowledge of which servers
                    in the cluster are up at any one time.

            <listitem>
                <para>Other servers. Servers in a cluster want to be able to create

        <para>
            This information, lets call it the Cluster Topology, is actually sent around normal HornetQ
            connections to clients and to other servers over cluster connections. This being the case we need a
            way of establishing the initial first connection. This can be done using
            dynamic discovery techniques like <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol" >UDP</ulink>
            and <ulink url="http://www.jgroups.org/">JGroups</ulink>, or by
            providing a list of initial connectors.

            <para>
                Server discovery uses <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol" >UDP</ulink>
                multicast or <ulink url="http://www.jgroups.org/">JGroups</ulink> to broadcast server connection settings.

            <section id="clusters.broadcast-groups">
                <title>Broadcast Groups</title>
                <para>A broadcast group is the means by which a server broadcasts connectors over the
                    network. A connector defines a way in which a client (or other server) can make
                    connections to the server. For more information on what a connector is, please see
                    <xref linkend="configuring-transports"/>.</para>
                <para>The broadcast group takes a set of connector pairs, each connector pair contains
                    connection settings for a live and backup server (if one exists) and broadcasts them on
                    the network. Depending on which broadcasting technique you configure the cluster, it
                    uses either UDP or JGroups to broadcast connector pairs information.</para>
                <para>Broadcast groups are defined in the server configuration file <literal
                        >hornetq-configuration.xml</literal>. There can be many broadcast groups per
                    HornetQ server. All broadcast groups must be defined in a <literal
                            >broadcast-groups</literal> element.</para>
                <para>Let's take a look at an example broadcast group from <literal
                        >hornetq-configuration.xml</literal> that defines a UDP broadcast group:</para>
                <programlisting>
     &lt;broadcast-groups>
     &lt;broadcast-group name="my-broadcast-group">
     &lt;local-bind-address>172.16.9.3&lt;/local-bind-address>
     &lt;local-bind-port>5432&lt;/local-bind-port>
     &lt;group-address>231.7.7.7&lt;/group-address>
     &lt;group-port>9876&lt;/group-port>
     &lt;broadcast-period>2000&lt;/broadcast-period>
     &lt;connector-ref connector-name="netty-connector"/>
     &lt;/broadcast-group>
     &lt;/broadcast-groups>
                </programlisting>
                <para>Some of the broadcast group parameters are optional and you'll normally use the
                    defaults, but we specify them all in the above example for clarity. Let's discuss
                    each one in turn:</para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>name</literal> attribute. Each broadcast group in the server must
                            have a unique name. </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>local-bind-address</literal>. This is the local bind address that
                            the datagram socket is bound to. If you have multiple network interfaces on
                            your server, you would specify which one you wish to use for broadcasts by
                            setting this property. If this property is not specified then the socket
                            will be bound to the wildcard address, an IP address chosen by the
                            kernel. This is a UDP specific attribute.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>local-bind-port</literal>. If you want to specify a local port to
                            which the datagram socket is bound you can specify it here. Normally you
                            would just use the default value of <literal>-1</literal> which signifies
                            that an anonymous port should be used. This parameter is alawys specified in conjunction with
                            <literal>local-bind-address</literal>. This is a UDP specific attribute.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>group-address</literal>. This is the multicast address to which
                            the data will be broadcast. It is a class D IP address in the range <literal
                                    >224.0.0.0</literal> to <literal>239.255.255.255</literal>, inclusive.
                            The address <literal>224.0.0.0</literal> is reserved and is not available
                            for use. This parameter is mandatory. This is a UDP specific attribute.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>group-port</literal>. This is the UDP port number used for
                            broadcasting. This parameter is mandatory. This is a UDP specific attribute.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>broadcast-period</literal>. This is the period in milliseconds
                            between consecutive broadcasts. This parameter is optional, the default
                            value is <literal>2000</literal> milliseconds.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>connector-ref</literal>. This specifies the connector and
                            optional backup connector that will be broadcasted (see <xref
                                    linkend="configuring-transports"/> for more information on connectors).
                            The connector to be broadcasted is specified by the <literal
                                    >connector-name</literal> attribute.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>

                <para>Here is another example broadcast group that defines a JGroups broadcast group:</para>
                <programlisting>
     &lt;broadcast-groups>
     &lt;broadcast-group name="my-broadcast-group">
     &lt;jgroups-file>test-jgroups-file_ping.xml&lt;/jgroups-file>
     &lt;jgroups-channel>hornetq_broadcast_channel&lt;/jgroups-channel>
     &lt;broadcast-period>2000&lt;/broadcast-period>
     &lt;connector-ref connector-name="netty-connector"/>
     &lt;/broadcast-group>
     &lt;/broadcast-groups>
                </programlisting>
                <para>To be able to use JGroups to broadcast, one must specify two attributes, i.e. 
                    <literal>jgroups-file</literal> and <literal>jgroups-channel</literal>, as discussed
                    in details as following:</para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>jgroups-file</literal> attribute. This is the name of JGroups configuration
                            file. It will be used to initialize JGroups channels. Make sure the file is in the 
                            java resource path so that HornetQ can load it. </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>jgroups-channel</literal> attribute. The name that JGroups channels connect
                        to for broadcasting.</para>
                    </listitem>

                <note>
                    <para>The JGroups attributes (<literal>jgroups-file</literal> and <literal>jgroups-channel</literal>)
                    and UDP specific attributes described above are exclusive of each other. Only one set can be
                    specified in a broadcast group configuration. Don't mix them!</para>

                    Each discovery group must be configured with broadcast endpoint (UDP or JGroups) that matches its broadcast
                    group counterpart. For example, if broadcast is configured using UDP, the discovery group must also use UDP, and the same
                    multicast address.

                <title>Defining Discovery Groups on the Server</title>
                <para>For cluster connections, discovery groups are defined in the server side
                    configuration file <literal>hornetq-configuration.xml</literal>. All discovery
                    groups must be defined inside a <literal>discovery-groups</literal> element. There
                    can be many discovery groups defined by HornetQ server. Let's look at an
                    example:</para>
                <programlisting>
       &lt;discovery-groups>
         &lt;discovery-group name="my-discovery-group">
           &lt;local-bind-address>172.16.9.7&lt;/local-bind-address>
           &lt;group-address>231.7.7.7&lt;/group-address>
           &lt;group-port>9876&lt;/group-port>
           &lt;refresh-timeout>10000&lt;/refresh-timeout>
         &lt;/discovery-group>
       &lt;/discovery-groups>
                </programlisting>
                <para>We'll consider each parameter of the discovery group:</para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>name</literal> attribute. Each discovery group must have a unique
                            name per server.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>local-bind-address</literal>. If you are running with multiple network interfaces on the same machine, you
                            may want to specify that the discovery group listens only only a specific interface. To do this you can specify the interface
                            address with this parameter. This parameter is optional. This is a UDP specific attribute.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>group-address</literal>. This is the multicast ip address of the
                            group to listen on. It should match the <literal>group-address</literal> in
                            the broadcast group that you wish to listen from. This parameter is
                            mandatory.  This is a UDP specific attribute.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>group-port</literal>. This is the UDP port of the multicast
                            group. It should match the <literal>group-port</literal> in the broadcast
                            group that you wish to listen from. This parameter is mandatory. This is a UDP specific attribute.</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>refresh-timeout</literal>. This is the period the discovery group
                            waits after receiving the last broadcast from a particular server before
                            removing that servers connector pair entry from its list. You would normally
                            set this to a value significantly higher than the <literal
                                    >broadcast-period</literal> on the broadcast group otherwise servers
                            might intermittently disappear from the list even though they are still
                            broadcasting due to slight differences in timing. This parameter is
                            optional, the default value is <literal>10000</literal> milliseconds (10
                            seconds).</para>

                </itemizedlist>
                <para>Here is another example that defines a JGroups discovery group:</para>
                <programlisting>
     &lt;discovery-groups>
     &lt;discovery-group name="my-broadcast-group">
     &lt;jgroups-file>test-jgroups-file_ping.xml&lt;/jgroups-file>
     &lt;jgroups-channel>hornetq_broadcast_channel&lt;/jgroups-channel>
     &lt;refresh-timeout>10000&lt;/refresh-timeout>
     &lt;/discovery-group>
     &lt;/discovery-groups>
                </programlisting>
                <para>To receive broadcast from JGroups channels, one must specify two attributes, 
                    <literal>jgroups-file</literal> and <literal>jgroups-channel</literal>, as discussed
                    in details as following:</para>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>jgroups-file</literal> attribute. This is the name of JGroups configuration
                            file. It will be used to initialize JGroups channels. Make sure the file is in the 
                            java resource path so that HornetQ can load it. </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><literal>jgroups-channel</literal> attribute. The name that JGroups channels connect
                        to for receiving broadcasts.</para>
                    </listitem>

                <note>

        <title>Server-Side Message Load Balancing</title>
        <para>If cluster connections are defined between nodes of a cluster, then HornetQ will load
            balance messages arriving at a particular node from a client.</para>
        <para>Let's take a simple example of a cluster of four nodes A, B, C, and D arranged in a
            <emphasis>symmetric cluster</emphasis> (described in <xref
                    linkend="symmetric-cluster"/>). We have a queue called <literal>OrderQueue</literal>
            deployed on each node of the cluster.</para>
        <para>We have client Ca connected to node A, sending orders to the server. We have also have
            order processor clients Pa, Pb, Pc, and Pd connected to each of the nodes A, B, C, D. If
            no cluster connection was defined on node A, then as order messages arrive on node A
            they will all end up in the <literal>OrderQueue</literal> on node A, so will only get
            consumed by the order processor client attached to node A, Pa.</para>
        <para>If we define a cluster connection on node A, then as ordered messages arrive on node A
            instead of all of them going into the local <literal>OrderQueue</literal> instance, they
            are distributed in a round-robin fashion between all the nodes of the cluster. The
            messages are forwarded from the receiving node to other nodes of the cluster. This is
            all done on the server side, the client maintains a single connection to node A.</para>
        <para>For example, messages arriving on node A might be distributed in the following order
            between the nodes: B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, B, D. The exact order depends on the order
            the nodes started up, but the algorithm used is round robin.</para>
        <para>HornetQ cluster connections can be configured to always blindly load balance messages
            in a round robin fashion irrespective of whether there are any matching consumers on
            other nodes, but they can be a bit cleverer than that and also be configured to only
            distribute to other nodes if they have matching consumers. We'll look at both these
            cases in turn with some examples, but first we'll discuss configuring cluster
            connections in general.</para>

            <para>Cluster connections group servers into clusters so that messages can be load
                balanced between the nodes of the cluster. Let's take a look at a typical cluster
                connection. Cluster connections are always defined in <literal
                        >hornetq-configuration.xml</literal> inside a <literal
                        >cluster-connection</literal> element. There can be zero or more cluster
                connections defined per HornetQ server.</para>

            <para>In the above cluster connection all parameters have been explicitly specified. The following

                    <para>In this case, this cluster connection will load balance messages sent to
                        address that start with <literal>jms</literal>. This cluster connection,
                        will, in effect apply to all JMS queue and topic subscriptions since they

                        balancing messages for those addresses, potentially to different clusters of
                        servers. By having multiple cluster connections on different addresses a
                        single HornetQ Server can effectively take part in multiple clusters

        </programlisting>
        <para>
            In this example we have set the attribute <literal>allow-direct-connections-only</literal> which means that
            the only server that this server can create a cluster connection to is server1-connector. This means you can
            explicitly create any cluster topology you want.

    <section id="clusters.message-redistribution">
        <title>Message Redistribution</title>
        <para>Another important part of clustering is message redistribution. Earlier we learned how
            server side message load balancing round robins messages across the cluster. If <literal
                    >forward-when-no-consumers</literal> is false, then messages won't be forwarded to
            nodes which don't have matching consumers, this is great and ensures that messages don't
            arrive on a queue which has no consumers to consume them, however there is a situation
            it doesn't solve: What happens if the consumers on a queue close after the messages have
            been sent to the node? If there are no consumers on the queue the message won't get
            consumed and we have a <emphasis>starvation</emphasis> situation.</para>
        <para>This is where message redistribution comes in. With message redistribution HornetQ can
            be configured to automatically <emphasis>redistribute</emphasis> messages from queues
            which have no consumers back to other nodes in the cluster which do have matching
            consumers.</para>
        <para>Message redistribution can be configured to kick in immediately after the last
            consumer on a queue is closed, or to wait a configurable delay after the last consumer
            on a queue is closed before redistributing. By default message redistribution is
            disabled.</para>
        <para>Message redistribution can be configured on a per address basis, by specifying the
            redistribution delay in the address settings, for more information on configuring
            address settings, please see <xref linkend="queue-attributes"/>.</para>
        <para>Here's an address settings snippet from <literal>hornetq-configuration.xml</literal>
            showing how message redistribution is enabled for a set of queues:</para>
        <programlisting>
   &lt;address-settings>
   &lt;address-setting match="jms.#">
   &lt;redistribution-delay>0&lt;/redistribution-delay>
   &lt;/address-setting>
   &lt;/address-settings>
        </programlisting>
        <para>The above <literal>address-settings</literal> block would set a <literal
                >redistribution-delay</literal> of <literal>0</literal> for any queue which is bound
            to an address that starts with "jms.". All JMS queues and topic subscriptions are bound
            to addresses that start with "jms.", so the above would enable instant (no delay)
            redistribution for all JMS queues and topic subscriptions.</para>
        <para>The attribute <literal>match</literal> can be an exact match or it can be a string
            that conforms to the HornetQ wildcard syntax (described in <xref
                    linkend="wildcard-syntax"/>).</para>
        <para>The element <literal>redistribution-delay</literal> defines the delay in milliseconds
            after the last consumer is closed on a queue before redistributing messages from that
            queue to other nodes of the cluster which do have matching consumers. A delay of zero
            means the messages will be immediately redistributed. A value of <literal>-1</literal>
            signifies that messages will never be redistributed. The default value is <literal
                    >-1</literal>.</para>
        <para>It often makes sense to introduce a delay before redistributing as it's a common case
            that a consumer closes but another one quickly is created on the same queue, in such a
            case you probably don't want to redistribute immediately since the new consumer will
            arrive shortly.</para>

        <title>Cluster topologies</title>
        <para>HornetQ clusters can be connected together in many different topologies, let's
            consider the two most common ones here</para>
        <section id="symmetric-cluster">
            <title>Symmetric cluster</title>
            <para>A symmetric cluster is probably the most common cluster topology, and you'll be
                familiar with if you've had experience of JBoss Application Server
                clustering.</para>
            <para>With a symmetric cluster every node in the cluster is connected to every other
                node in the cluster. In other words every node in the cluster is no more than one
                hop away from every other node.</para>
            <para>To form a symmetric cluster every node in the cluster defines a cluster connection
                with the attribute <literal>max-hops</literal> set to <literal>1</literal>.
                Typically the cluster connection will use server discovery in order to know what
                other servers in the cluster it should connect to, although it is possible to
                explicitly define each target server too in the cluster connection if, for example,
                UDP is not available on your network.</para>
            <para>With a symmetric cluster each node knows about all the queues that exist on all
                the other nodes and what consumers they have. With this knowledge it can determine
                how to load balance and redistribute messages around the nodes.</para>
            <para>Don't forget <link linkend="copy-warning">this warning</link> when creating a
                symmetric cluster.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Chain cluster</title>
            <para>With a chain cluster, each node in the cluster is not connected to every node in
                the cluster directly, instead the nodes form a chain with a node on each end of the
                chain and all other nodes just connecting to the previous and next nodes in the
                chain.</para>
            <para>An example of this would be a three node chain consisting of nodes A, B and C.
                Node A is hosted in one network and has many producer clients connected to it
                sending order messages. Due to corporate policy, the order consumer clients need to
                be hosted in a different network, and that network is only accessible via a third
                network. In this setup node B acts as a mediator with no producers or consumers on
                it. Any messages arriving on node A will be forwarded to node B, which will in turn
                forward them to node C where they can get consumed. Node A does not need to directly
                connect to C, but all the nodes can still act as a part of the cluster.</para>
            <para>To set up a cluster in this way, node A would define a cluster connection that
                connects to node B, and node B would define a cluster connection that connects to
                node C. In this case we only want cluster connections in one direction since we're
                only moving messages from node A->B->C and never from C->B->A.</para>
            <para>For this topology we would set <literal>max-hops</literal> to <literal
                    >2</literal>. With a value of <literal>2</literal> the knowledge of what queues and
                consumers that exist on node C would be propagated from node C to node B to node A.
                Node A would then know to distribute messages to node B when they arrive, even
                though node B has no consumers itself, it would know that a further hop away is node
                C which does have consumers.</para>
