<chapter id="persistence">
    <title>Persistence</title>
    <para>In this chapter we will describe how persistence works with HornetQ and how to configure
        it.</para>
    <para>HornetQ ships with a high performance journal. Since HornetQ handles its own persistence,
        rather than relying on a database or other 3rd party persistence engine it is very highly
        optimised for the specific messaging use cases.</para>
    <para>A HornetQ journal is an <emphasis>append only</emphasis> journal. It consists of a set of
        files on disk. Each file is pre-created to a fixed size and initially filled with padding.
        As operations are performed on the server, e.g. add message, update message, delete message,
        records are appended to the journal. When one journal file is full we move to the next
        one.</para>
    <para>Because records are only appended, i.e. added to the end of the journal we minimise disk
        head movement, i.e. we minimise random access operations which is typically the slowest
        operation on a disk.</para>
    <para>Making the file size configurable means that an optimal size can be chosen, i.e. making
        each file fit on a disk cylinder. Modern disk topologies are complex and we are not in
        control over which cylinder(s) the file is mapped onto so this is not an exact science. But
        by minimising the number of disk cylinders the file is using, we can minimise the amount of
        disk head movement, since an entire disk cylinder is accessible simply by the disk rotating
        - the head does not have to move.</para>
    <para>As delete records are added to the journal, HornetQ has a sophisticated file garbage
        collection algorithm which can determine if a particular journal file is needed any more -
        i.e. has all its data been deleted in the same or other files. If so, the file can be
        reclaimed and re-used. </para>
    <para>HornetQ also has a compaction algorithm which removes dead space from the journal and
        compresses up the data so it takes up less files on disk.</para>
    <para>The journal also fully supports transactional operation if required, supporting both local
        and XA transactions.</para>
    <para>The majority of the journal is written in Java, however we abstract out the interaction
        with the actual file system to allow different pluggable implementations. HornetQ ships with
        two implementations:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Java <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_I/O">NIO</ulink>.</para>
            <para>The first implementation uses standard Java NIO to interface with the file system.
                This provides extremely good performance and runs on any platform where there's a
                Java 6+ runtime.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem id="aio-journal">
            <para>Linux Asynchronous IO</para>
            <para>The second implementation uses a thin native code wrapper to talk to the Linux
                asynchronous IO library (AIO). With AIO, HornetQ will be called back when the data
                has made it to disk, allowing us to avoid explicit syncs altogether and simply send
                back confirmation of completion when AIO informs us that the data has been
                persisted.</para>
            <para>Using AIO will typically provide even better performance than using Java
                NIO.</para>
            <para>The AIO journal is only available when running Linux kernel 2.6 or later and after
                having installed libaio (if it's not already installed). For instructions on how to
                install libaio please see <xref linkend="installing-aio"/>.</para>
            <para>Also, please note that AIO will only work with the following file systems: ext2,
                ext3, ext4, jfs, xfs. With other file systems, e.g. NFS it may appear to work, but
                it will fall back to a slower synchronous behaviour. Don't put the journal on a NFS
                share!</para>
            <para>For more information on libaio please see <xref linkend="libaio"/>.</para>
            <para>libaio is part of the kernel project.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The standard HornetQ core server uses two instances of the journal:</para>
    <itemizedlist id="persistence.journallist">
        <listitem>
            <para>Bindings journal.</para>
            <para>This journal is used to store bindings related data. That includes the set of
                queues that are deployed on the server and their attributes. It also stores data
                such as id sequence counters. </para>
            <para>The bindings journal is always a NIO journal as it is typically low throughput
                compared to the message journal.</para>
            <para>The files on this journal are prefixed as <literal>hornetq-bindings</literal>.
                Each file has a <literal>bindings</literal> extension. File size is <literal
                    >1048576</literal>, and it is located at the bindings folder.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>JMS journal.</para>
            <para>This journal instance stores all JMS related data, This is basically any JMS
                Queues, Topics and Connection Factories and any JNDI bindings for these
                resources.</para>
            <para>Any JMS Resources created via the management API will be persisted to this
                journal. Any resources configured via configuration files will not. The JMS Journal
                will only be created if JMS is being used.</para>
            <para>The files on this journal are prefixed as <literal>hornetq-jms</literal>. Each
                file has a <literal>jms</literal> extension. File size is <literal
                >1048576</literal>, and it is located at the bindings folder.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Message journal.</para>
            <para>This journal instance stores all message related data, including the message
                themselves and also duplicate-id caches.</para>
            <para>By default HornetQ will try and use an AIO journal. If AIO is not available, e.g.
                the platform is not Linux with the correct kernel version or AIO has not been
                installed then it will automatically fall back to using Java NIO which is available
                on any Java platform.</para>
            <para>The files on this journal are prefixed as <literal>hornetq-data</literal>. Each
                file has a <literal>hq</literal> extension. File size is by the default <literal
                    >10485760</literal> (configurable), and it is located at the journal
                folder.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>For large messages, HornetQ persists them outside the message journal. This is discussed
        in <xref linkend="large-messages"/>.</para>
    <para>HornetQ can also be configured to page messages to disk in low memory situations. This is
        discussed in <xref linkend="paging"/>.</para>
    <para>If no persistence is required at all, HornetQ can also be configured not to persist any
        data at all to storage as discussed in <xref linkend="persistence.enabled"/>.</para>

                <para>For the best performance, we recommend the journal is located on its own

                    (e.g. bindings journal, database, or transaction coordinator) then the disk head
                    may well be moving rapidly between these files as it writes them, thus
                    drastically reducing performance.</para>
                <para>When the message journal is stored on a SAN we recommend each journal instance

                <para>Instead of flushing on every write that requires a flush, we maintain an

        <title>An important note on disabling disk write cache.</title>
        <warning>
            <para>Most disks contain hardware write caches. A write cache can increase the apparent
                performance of the disk because writes just go into the cache and are then lazily
                written to the disk later. </para>

                operating system or correctly synced data from inside a Java program!</para>
            <para>By default many systems ship with disk write cache enabled. This means that even
                after syncing from the operating system there is no guarantee the data has actually
                made it to disk, so if a failure occurs, critical data can be lost.</para>
            <para>Some more expensive disks have non volatile or battery backed write caches which
                won't necessarily lose data on event of failure, but you need to test them!</para>
            <para>If your disk does not have an expensive non volatile or battery backed cache and
                it's not part of some kind of redundant array (e.g. RAID), and you value your data
                integrity you need to make sure disk write cache is disabled.</para>
            <para>Be aware that disabling disk write cache can give you a nasty shock performance
                wise. If you've been used to using disks with write cache enabled in their default
                setting, unaware that your data integrity could be compromised, then disabling it
                will give you an idea of how fast your disk can perform when acting really
                reliably.</para>
            <para>On Linux you can inspect and/or change your disk's write cache settings using the
                tools <literal>hdparm</literal> (for IDE disks) or <literal>sdparm</literal> or
                    <literal>sginfo</literal> (for SDSI/SATA disks)</para>
            <para>On Windows you can check / change the setting by right clicking on the disk and
                clicking properties.</para>

        <title>Installing AIO</title>
        <para>The Java NIO journal gives great performance, but If you are running HornetQ using
            Linux Kernel 2.6 or later, we highly recommend you use the <literal>AIO</literal>
            journal for the very best persistence performance.</para>
        <para>It's not possible to use the AIO journal under other operating systems or earlier
            versions of the Linux kernel.</para>
        <para>If you are running Linux kernel 2.6 or later and don't already have <literal

            steps:</para>
        <para>Using yum, (e.g. on Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux):
            <programlisting>yum install libaio</programlisting></para>

        <title>Configuring HornetQ for Zero Persistence</title>
        <para>In some situations, zero persistence is sometimes required for a messaging system.
            Configuring HornetQ to perform zero persistence is straightforward. Simply set the
            parameter <literal>persistence-enabled</literal> in <literal
                >hornetq-configuration.xml</literal> to <literal>false</literal>. </para>
        <para>Please note that if you set this parameter to false, then <emphasis>zero</emphasis>
            persistence will occur. That means no bindings data, message data, large message data,
            duplicate id caches or paging data will be persisted.</para>

        <para>You may want to inspect the existent records on each one of the journals used by
            HornetQ, and you can use the export/import tool for that purpose. The export/import are
            classes located at the hornetq-core.jar, you can export the journal as a text file by
            using this command:</para>
