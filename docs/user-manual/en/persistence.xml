    <title>Persistence</title>
    <para>In this chapter we will describe how persistence works with JBoss Messaging and how to
        configure it.</para>
    <para>JBoss Messaging ships with a high performance journal. This journal has been implemented
        by the JBoss Messaging team with a view to providing high performance in a messaging system.
        Since JBoss Messaging handles its own persistence, rather than relying on a database or
        other 3rd party persistence engine, we have been able to tune the journal to gain optimal
        performance for the persistence of messages and transactions.</para>
    <para>A JBoss Messaging journal is an <emphasis>append only</emphasis> journal. It consists of a
        set of files on disk. Each file is pre-created to a fixed size and initially filled with
        padding. As operations are performed on the server, e.g. add message, update message, delete
        message, records are appended to the journal. When one journal file is full we move to the
        next one.</para>
    <para>Because records are only appended, i.e. added to the end of the journal we minimise disk
        head movement, i.e. we minimise random access operations.</para>
    <para>Making the file size configurable means that an optimal size can be chosen, i.e. making
        each file fit on a disk cylinder. Modern disk topologies are complex and we are not in
        control over which cylinder(s) the file is mapped onto so this is not an exact science. But
        by minimising the number of disk cylinders the file is using, we can minimise the amount of
        disk head movement, since an entire disk cylinder is accessible simply by the disk rotating
        - the head does not have to move.</para>
    <para>As delete records are added to the journal, JBoss Messaging has a sophisticated file
        garbage collection algorithm which can determine if a particular journal file is needed any
        more - i.e. has all it's data been deleted in the same or other files. If so, the file can
        be reclaimed and re-used. </para>
    <para>JBoss Messaging also has a compaction algorithm which removes dead space from the journal
        and compresses up the data so it takes up less files on disk.</para>
    <para>The journal also fully supports transactional operation if required, supporting both local
        and XA transactions.</para>
    <para>The majority of the journal is written in Java, however we abstract out the interaction
        with the actual file system to allow different pluggable implementations. We ship JBoss
        Messaging with two implementations:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Java <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_I/O">NIO</ulink>.</para>
            <para>The first implementation uses standard Java NIO to interface with the file system.
                This provides very good performance and runs on any platform where there's a
                JDK.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem id="aio-journal">
            <para>Linux Asynchronous IO</para>
            <para>The second implementation uses a thin native code wrapper to talk to the Linux
                asynchronous IO library (AIO). In a highly concurrent environment, AIO can provide
                better overall persistent throughput since it does not require each individual
                transaction boundary to be synced to disk. Most disks can only support a limited
                number of syncs per second, so a syncing approach does not scale well when the
                number of concurrent transactions needed to be committed grows too large. With AIO,
                JBoss Messaging will be called back when the data has made it to disk, allowing us
                to avoid explicit syncs altogether and simply send back confirmation of completion
                when AIO informs us that the data has been persisted.</para>
            <para>The AIO journal is only available when running Linux kernel 2.6 or later and after
                having installed libaio (if it's not already installed). For instructions on how to
                install libaio please see <xref linkend="installing-aio"/>.</para>
            <para>libaio is part of the kernel project.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The standard JBoss Messaging core server uses two instances of the journal:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Bindings journal.</para>
            <para>This journal is used to store bindings related data. That includes the set of
                queues that are deployed on the server and their attributes. It also stores data
                such as id sequence counters. </para>
            <para>The bindings journal is always a NIO journal as it is typically low throughput
                compared to the message journal.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Message journal.</para>
            <para>This journal instance stores all message related data, including the message
                themselves and also duplicate id caches.</para>
            <para>By default JBoss Messaging will try and use an AIO journal. If AIO is not
                available, e.g. the platform is not Linux with the correct kernel version or AIO has
                not been installed then it will automatically fall back to using Java NIO which is
                available on any Java platform.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>For large messages, JBoss Messaging persists them outside the message journal. This is
        discussed in <xref linkend="large-messages"/>.</para>
    <para>JBoss Messaging also pages messages to disk in low memory situations. This is discussed in
            <xref linkend="paging"/>.</para>
    <para>If no persistence is required at all, JBoss Messaging can also be configured not to
        persist any data at all to storage as discussed in <xref linkend="persistence.enabled"
        />.</para>

                <para>For the best performance, we recommend the journal is located on its own

                    volume which is shared with other processes which might be writing other files
                    (e.g. bindings journal, database, or transaction coordinator) then the disk head
                    may well be moving rapidly between these files as it writes them, thus reducing
                    performance.</para>
                <para>When the message journal is stored on a SAN we recommend each journal instance

        <para> In some situations, zero persistence is sometimes required for a messaging system.
            Configuring JBoss Messaging to perform zero persistence is straightforward. Simply set
            the parameter <literal>persistence-enabled</literal> in <literal

            persistence will occur. That means no bindings data, message data, large message data,
