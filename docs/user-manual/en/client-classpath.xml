    <title>The Client Classpath</title>
    <para>HornetQ requires several jars on the <emphasis>Client Classpath</emphasis> depending on
        whether the client uses HornetQ Core API, JMS, and JNDI.</para>
    <warning>
        <para>All the jars mentioned here can be found in the <literal>lib</literal> directory of
            the HornetQ distribution. Be sure you only use the jars from the correct version of the
            release, you <emphasis>must not</emphasis> mix and match versions of jars from different
            HornetQ versions. Mixing and matching different jar versions may cause subtle errors and
            failures to occur.</para>
    </warning>
    <section>
        <title>HornetQ Core Client</title>
        <para>If you are using just a pure HornetQ Core client (i.e. no JMS) then you need <literal
                >hornetq-core-client.jar</literal> and
                <literal>netty.jar</literal> on your client classpath.</para>
        <para>If the client runs inside a <emphasis>Java 5 virtual machine</emphasis>, use instead <literal>hornetq-core-client-java5.jar</literal>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>JMS Client</title>
        <para>If you are using JMS on the client side, then you will also need to include <literal
                >hornetq-jms-client.jar</literal> and <literal>jboss-jms-api.jar</literal>.</para>
        <para>If the client runs inside a <emphasis>Java 5 virtual machine</emphasis>, include instead <literal>hornetq-jms-client-java5.jar</literal>.</para>
        
        <note>
            <para><literal>jboss-jms-api.jar</literal> just contains Java EE API interface classes
                needed for the <literal>javax.jms.*</literal> classes. If you already have a jar
                with these interface classes on your classpath, you will not need it.</para>
        </note>
        
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>JMS Client with JNDI</title>
        <para>If you are looking up JMS resources from the JNDI server co-located with the HornetQ
            standalone server, you will also need the jar <literal>jnp-client.jar</literal> jar on
            your client classpath as well as any other jars mentioned previously.</para>
