<chapter id="logging">
    <title>Logging</title>
    <para>HornetQ has its own logging delegate that has no dependencies on any particular logging
        framework. The default delegate delegates all its logs to the standard <ulink
            url="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/">JDK logging</ulink>,
        (a.k.a Java-Util-Logging: JUL). By default the server picks up its JUL configuration from a
            <literal>logging.properties</literal> file found in the config directories. This is
        configured to use our own HornetQ logging formatter and will log to the console as well as a
        log file. For more information on configuring JUL visit Suns website.</para>
    <para>You can configure a different Logging Delegate programatically or via a System
        Property.</para>
    <para>To do this programatically simply do the
        following<programlisting>org.hornetq.core.logging.Logger.setDelegateFactory(new Log4jLogDelegateFactory())</programlisting></para>
    <para>Where <literal>Log4jLogDelegateFactory</literal> is the implementation of <literal
            >org.hornetq.spi.core.logging.LogDelegateFactory </literal>that you would like to
        use.</para>
    <para>To do this via a System Property simply set the property <literal
            >org.hornetq.logger-delegate-factory-class-name</literal> to the delegate factory being
        used,
        i.e.<programlisting>-Dorg.hornetq.logger-delegate-factory-class-name=org.hornetq.integration.logging.Log4jLogDelegateFactory</programlisting></para>
    <para>As you can see in the above example HornetQ provides some Delegate Factories for your
        convenience. these are<orderedlist
                    ><listitem><para>org.hornetq.core.logging.impl.JULLogDelegateFactory - the
                    default that uses
                    JUL.</para></listitem><listitem><para>org.hornetq.integration.logging.Log4jLogDelegateFactory
                    - which uses Log4J</para></listitem></orderedlist></para>
    <para>If you configure your client's logging to use the JUL delegate, make sure you provide a
            <literal>logging.properties</literal> file and set the <literal
            >java.util.logging.config.file</literal> property on client startup</para>
    <section>
        <title>Logging With The JBoss Application Server</title>
        <para>When HornetQ is deployed within the JBoss Application Server version 5.x or above then
            it will still use JUL however the logging is redirected to the default JBoss logger. For
            more information on this refer to the JBoss documentation. In versions before this you
            must specify what logger delegate you want to use.</para>
