    <title>Large Messages</title>
    <para>HornetQ supports sending and receiving of huge messages, even when the client and server
        are running with limited memory. The only realistic limit to the size of a message that can
        be sent or consumed is the amount of disk space you have available. We have tested sending
        and consuming messages up to 8 GiB in size with a client and server running in just 50MiB of
        RAM!</para>
    <para>To send a large message, the user can set an <literal>InputStream</literal> on a message
        body, and when that message is sent, HornetQ will read the <literal>InputStream</literal>. A
            <literal>FileInputStream</literal> could be used for example to send a huge message from
        a huge file on disk.</para>
    <para>As the <literal>InputStream</literal> is read the data is sent to the server as a stream
        of fragments. The server persists these fragments to disk as it receives them and when the
        time comes to deliver them to a consumer they are read back of the disk, also in fragments
        and sent down the wire. When the consumer receives a large message it initially receives
        just the message with an empty body, it can then set an <literal>OutputStream</literal> on
        the message to stream the huge message body to a file on disk or elsewhere. At no time is
        the entire message body stored fully in memory, either on the client or the server.</para>
    <section id="large.message.configuring">
        <title>Configuring the server</title>
        <para>Large messages are stored on a disk directory on the server side, as configured on the
            main configuration file.</para>
        <para>The configuration property <literal>large-messages-directory</literal> specifies where
            large messages are stored.</para>

&lt;/configuration</programlisting>
        <para>By default the large message directory is <literal>data/largemessages</literal></para>
        <para>For the best performance we recommend large messages directory is stored on a
            different physical volume to the message journal or paging directory.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Configuring Parameters</title>
        <para>Any message larger than a certain size is considered a large message. Large messages
            will be split up and sent in fragments. This is determined by the parameter <literal
                >min-large-message-size</literal></para>
        <para>The default value is 100KiB.</para>

            <title>Using Core API</title>
            <para>If the HornetQ Core API is used, the minimal large message size is specified by

ServerLocator locator = HornetQClient.createServerLocatorWithoutHA(new TransportConfiguration(NettyConnectorFactory.class.getName()))

            <title>Using JMS</title>
            <para>If JNDI is used to look up the connection factory, the minimum large message size
                is specified in <literal>hornetq-jms.xml</literal></para>

            <para>If the connection factory is being instantiated directly, the minimum large

            <title>Compressed Large Messages</title>
            <para>
				You can choose to send large messages in compressed form using <literal>
				compress-large-messages</literal> attributes.
            </para>
            <section>
				<title><literal>compress-large-messages</literal></title>
                <para>If you specify the boolean property <literal>compress-large-messages</literal> on
                the <literal>server locator</literal> or <literal>ConnectionFactory</literal> as true, The
                system will use the ZIP algorithm to compress the message body as the message is
                transferred to the server's side. Notice that there's no special treatment at the
                server's side, all the compressing and uncompressing is done at the client.</para>
                <para>If the compressed size of a large message is below <literal>
                min-large-message-size</literal>, it is sent to server as regular messages. This means
			    that the message won't be written into the server's large-message
			    data directory, thus reducing the disk I/O.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <para>If you use JMS, you can achieve large messages compression by configuring your 
                connection factories. For example,</para>
            <programlisting>...
&lt;connection-factory name="ConnectionFactory">
   &lt;connectors>
      &lt;connector-ref connector-name="netty"/>

    <section>
        <title>Streaming large messages</title>
        <para>HornetQ supports setting the body of messages using input and output streams (<literal
                >java.lang.io</literal>)</para>
        <para>These streams are then used directly for sending (input streams) and receiving (output
            streams) messages.</para>
        <para>When receiving messages there are 2 ways to deal with the output stream; you may
            choose to block while the output stream is recovered using the method <literal
                >ClientMessage.saveOutputStream</literal> or alternatively using the method <literal
                >ClientMessage.setOutputstream</literal> which will asynchronously write the message
            to the stream. If you choose the latter the consumer must be kept alive until the
            message has been fully received.</para>
        <para>You can use any kind of stream you like. The most common use case is to send files
            stored in your disk, but you could also send things like JDBC Blobs, <literal
                >SocketInputStream</literal>, things you recovered from <literal
                >HTTPRequests</literal> etc. Anything as long as it implements <literal
                >java.io.InputStream</literal> for sending messages or <literal
                >java.io.OutputStream</literal> for receiving them.</para>

            <para>The following table shows a list of methods available at <literal
                    >ClientMessage</literal> which are also available through JMS by the use of
