    <title>Paging</title>
    <para>HornetQ transparently supports huge queues containing millions of messages while the
        server is running with limited memory.</para>
    <para>In such a situation it's not possible to store all of the queues in memory at any one
        time, so HornetQ transparently <emphasis>pages</emphasis> messages into and out of memory as
        they are needed, thus allowing massive queues with a low memory footprint.</para>
    <para>HornetQ will start paging messages to disk, when the size of all messages in memory for an
        address exceeds a configured maximum size.</para>
    <para>By default, HornetQ does not page messages - this must be explicitly configured to
        activate it.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Page Files</title>
        <para>Messages are stored per address on the file system. Each address has an individual
            folder where messages are stored in multiple files (page files). Each file will contain
            messages up to a max configured size (<literal>page-size-bytes</literal>). The system
            will navigate on the files as needed, and it will remove the page file as soon as all
            the messages are acknowledged up to that point.</para>
        <para>Browsers will read through the page-cursor system.</para>
        <para>Consumers with selectors will also navigate through the page-files and it will ignore
            messages that don't match the criteria.</para>

        <title>Dropping messages and throwing an exception to producers</title>
        <para>Instead of paging messages when the max size is reached, an address can also be

            when the address is full.</para>
        <para>To do this just set the <literal>address-full-policy</literal> to <literal

    <section>
        <title>Blocking producers</title>
        <para>Instead of paging messages when the max size is reached, an address can also be
            configured to block producers from sending further messages when the address is full,
            thus preventing the memory being exhausted on the server.</para>
        <para>When memory is freed up on the server, producers will automatically unblock and be
            able to continue sending.</para>
        <para>To do this just set the <literal>address-full-policy</literal> to <literal
                >BLOCK</literal> in the address settings</para>
        <para>In the default configuration, all addresses are configured to block producers after 10
            MiB of data are in the address.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Caution with Addresses with Multiple Queues</title>
        <para>When a message is routed to an address that has multiple queues bound to it, e.g. a
            JMS subscription in a Topic, there is only 1 copy of the message in memory. Each queue
            only deals with a reference to this. Because of this the memory is only freed up once
            all queues referencing the message have delivered it.</para>
        <para>If you have a single lazy subscription, the entire address will suffer IO performance
            hit as all the queues will have messages being sent through an extra storage on the
            paging system.</para>
        <para>For example:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>An address has 10 queues </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>One of the queues does not deliver its messages (maybe because of a slow
                    consumer).</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Messages continually arrive at the address and paging is started.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The other 9 queues are empty even though messages have been sent.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>In this example all the other 9 queues will be consuming messages from the page
            system. This may cause performance issues if this is an undesirable state.</para>
