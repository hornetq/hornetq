    <title>REST Interface</title>

    <para>The HornetQ REST interface allows you to leverage the reliability
        and scalability features of HornetQ over a simple REST/HTTP interface.
        Messages are produced and consumed by sending and receiving simple HTTP
        messages that contain the content you want to push around. For instance,
        here's a simple example of posting an order to an order processing queue
        express as an HTTP message:
    </para>

    <programlisting>
POST /queue/orders/create HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/xml

&lt;order>
   &lt;name>Bill&lt;/name>
   &lt;item>iPhone 4&lt;/item>
   &lt;cost>$199.99&lt;/cost>
&lt;/order></programlisting>

    <para>As you can see, we're just posting some arbitrary XML
        document to a URL. When the XML is received on the server is it processed
        within HornetQ as a JMS message and distributed through core HornetQ.
        Simple and easy. Consuming messages from a queue or topic looks very
        similar. We'll discuss the entire interface in detail later in this
        docbook.
    </para>

        <title>Goals of REST Interface</title>

        <para>Why would you want to use HornetQ's REST interface? What are the
            goals of the REST interface?
        </para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>Zero client footprint. We want HornetQ to be usable by any
                    client/programming language that has an adequate HTTP client
                    library. You shouldn't have to download, install, and configure a
                    special library to interact with HornetQ.

            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>Lightweight interoperability. The HTTP protocol is strong
                    enough to be our message exchange protocol. Since interactions are
                    RESTful the HTTP uniform interface provides all the interoperability
                    you need to communicate between different languages, platforms, and
                    even messaging implementations that choose to implement the same
                    RESTful interface as HornetQ (i.e. the
                    <ulink url="http://rest-star.org">REST-*</ulink> effort.)

    <section id="install">
        <title>Installation and Configuration</title>

        <para>HornetQ's REST interface is installed as a Web archive (WAR). It
            depends on the
            <ulink url="http://jboss.org/resteasy">RESTEasy</ulink>
            project and can currently only run within a servlet container. Installing
            the HornetQ REST interface is a little bit different depending whether
            HornetQ is already installed and configured for your environment (e.g.
            you're deploying within JBoss AS 7) or you want the HornetQ REST
            WAR to startup and manage the HornetQ server (e.g. you're deploying
            within something like Apache Tomcat).
        </para>

        <section>
            <title>Installing Within Pre-configured Environment</title>

            <para>This section should be used when you want to use the HornetQ REST
                interface in an environment that already has HornetQ installed and
                running, e.g. JBoss AS 7. You must create a Web archive
                (.WAR) file with the following web.xml settings:
            </para>

            <programlisting>
&lt;web-app>
   &lt;listener>
      &lt;listener-class>

   &lt;listener>
      &lt;listener-class>
         org.hornetq.rest.integration.RestMessagingBootstrapListener
      &lt;/listener-class>

&lt;/web-app></programlisting>

            <para>Within your WEB-INF/lib directory you must have the
                hornetq-rest.jar file. If RESTEasy is not installed within your
                environment, you must add the RESTEasy jar files within the lib
                directory as well. Here's a sample Maven pom.xml that can build your WAR
                for this case.

            <para>
                It is worth noting that when deploying a WAR in a Java EE application server
                like AS7 the URL for the resulting application will include the name of the
                WAR by default.  For example, if you've constructed a WAR as described above
                named "hornetq-rest.war" then clients will access it at, e.g.
                http://localhost:8080/hornetq-rest/[queues|topics].  We'll see more about
                this later.
            </para>
            <note>
                <para>
                    It is possible to put the WAR file at the "root context" of AS7, but
                    that is beyond the scope of this documentation.

        <section>
            <title>Bootstrapping HornetQ Along with REST</title>

            <para>You can bootstrap HornetQ within your WAR as well. To do this, you
                must have the HornetQ core and JMS jars along with Netty, Resteasy, and
                the HornetQ REST jar within your WEB-INF/lib. You must also have a
                hornetq-configuration.xml, hornetq-jms.xml, and hornetq-users.xml config
                files within WEB-INF/classes. The examples that come with the HornetQ
                REST distribution show how to do this. You must also add an additional
                listener to your web.xml file. Here's an example:
            </para>

            <programlisting>
&lt;web-app>
   &lt;listener>
      &lt;listener-class>
         org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.ResteasyBootstrap
      &lt;/listener-class>
   &lt;/listener>

   &lt;listener>
      &lt;listener-class>
         org.hornetq.rest.integration.HornetqBootstrapListener
      &lt;/listener-class>
   &lt;/listener>

   &lt;listener>
      &lt;listener-class>
         org.hornetq.rest.integration.RestMessagingBootstrapListener
      &lt;/listener-class>
   &lt;/listener>

   &lt;filter>
      &lt;filter-name>Rest-Messaging&lt;/filter-name>
      &lt;filter-class>
         org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.FilterDispatcher
      &lt;/filter-class>

      &lt;filter-name>Rest-Messaging&lt;/filter-name>
      &lt;url-pattern>/*&lt;/url-pattern>
   &lt;/filter-mapping>
&lt;/web-app></programlisting>

            <para>Here's a Maven pom.xml file for creating a WAR for this
                environment. Make sure your hornetq configuration files are within the
                src/main/resources directory so that they are stuffed within the WAR's

        <title>HornetQ REST Interface Basics</title>

        <para>The HornetQ REST interface publishes a variety of REST resources to
            perform various tasks on a queue or topic. Only the top-level queue and
            topic URI schemes are published to the outside world. You must discover
            all over resources to interact with by looking for and traversing links.
            You'll find published links within custom response headers and embedded in
            published XML representations. Let's look at how this works.
        </para>

        <section>
            <title>Queue and Topic Resources</title>

            <para>To interact with a queue or topic you do a HEAD or GET request on
                the following relative URI pattern:
            </para>

            <programlisting>
/queues/{name}
/topics/{name}</programlisting>

            <para>The base of the URI is the base URL of the WAR you deployed the
                HornetQ REST server within as defined in the
                <link linkend="install">Installation and Configuration</link>
                section of this document. Replace the <literal>{name}</literal>
                string within the above URI pattern with the name of the queue or
                topic you are interested in interacting with. For example if you
                have configured a JMS topic named "foo" within your
                <literal>hornetq-jms.xml</literal> file, the URI name should be
                "jms.topic.foo". If you have configured a JMS queue name "bar" within
                your <literal>hornetq-jms.xml</literal> file, the URI name should be
                "jms.queue.bar". Internally, HornetQ prepends the "jms.topic" or
                "jms.queue" strings to the name of the deployed destination. Next,
                perform your HEAD or GET request on this URI. Here's what a
                request/response would look like.
            </para>

            <programlisting>
HEAD /queues/jms.queue.bar HTTP/1.1

                    a command like this:

curl --head http://example.com/queues/jms.queue.bar</programlisting>
            </note>

            <para>The HEAD or GET response contains a number of custom response
                headers that are URLs to additional REST resources that allow you to
                interact with the queue or topic in different ways. It is important not
                to rely on the scheme of the URLs returned within these headers as they
                are an implementation detail. Treat them as opaque and query for them
                each and every time you initially interact (at boot time) with the
                server. If you treat all URLs as opaque then you will be isolated from
                implementation changes as the HornetQ REST interface evolves over
                time.

        <title>Posting Messages</title>

        <para>This chapter discusses the protocol for posting messages to a queue
            or a topic. In <link linkend="basics">HornetQ REST Interface Basics</link>,
            you saw that a queue or topic resource publishes variable custom headers
            that are links to other RESTful resources. The <literal>msg-create</literal>
            header is a URL you can post a message to. Messages are published to a queue
            or topic by sending a simple HTTP message to the URL published by the
            <literal>msg-create</literal> header. The HTTP message contains whatever
            content you want to publish to the HornetQ destination. Here's an example
            scenario:

        <section>
            <title>Duplicate Detection</title>

            <para>Sometimes you might have network problems when posting new
                messages to a queue or topic. You may do a POST and never receive a
                response. Unfortunately, you don't know whether or not the server
                received the message and so a re-post of the message might cause
                duplicates to be posted to the queue or topic. By default, the HornetQ
                REST interface is configured to accept and post duplicate messages. You
                can change this by turning on duplicate message detection by setting the
                <literal>dups-ok</literal> config option to <literal>false</literal>
                as described in <link linkend="basics">HornetQ REST Interface Basics</link>.
                When you do this, the initial POST to the <literal>msg-create</literal>
                URL will redirect you, using the standard HTTP 307 redirection mechanism
                to a unique URL to POST to. All other interactions remain the same as
                discussed earlier. Here's an example:

            <para>How can this work? As you can see, with each successful response,
                the HornetQ REST server returns a uniquely generated URL within the
                msg-create-next header. This URL is dedicated to the next new message
                you want to post. Behind the scenes, the code extracts an identify from
                the URL and uses HornetQ's duplicate detection mechanism by setting the
                <literal>DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID</literal> property of the JMS message
                that is actually posted to the system.
            </para>

            <para>If you happen to use the same ID more than once you'll see a message
                like this on the server:
            </para>
            <programlisting>
WARN  [org.hornetq.core.server] (Thread-3 (HornetQ-remoting-threads-HornetQServerImpl::serverUUID=8d6be6f8-5e8b-11e2-80db-51bbde66f473-26319292-267207)) HQ112098: Duplicate message detected - message will not be routed. Message information:

            <para>An alternative to this approach is to use the <literal>msg-create-with-id</literal>
                header. This is not an invokable URL, but a URL template. The idea is that
                the client provides the <literal>DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID</literal> and creates
                its own <literal>create-next</literal> URL. The <literal>msg-create-with-id</literal>
                header looks like this (you've see it in previous examples, but we haven't used it):
            </para>

            <programlisting>
msg-create-with-id: http://example.com/queues/jms.queue.bar/create/{id}</programlisting>

            <para>You see that it is a regular URL appended with a <literal>{id}</literal>. This
                <literal>{id}</literal> is a pattern matching substring. A client would generate its
                <literal>DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID</literal> and replace <literal>{id}</literal>
                with that generated id, then POST to the new URL. The URL the client creates
                works exactly like a <literal>create-next</literal> URL described earlier. The 
                response of this POST would also return a new <literal>msg-create-next</literal>
                header. The client can continue to generate its own DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID, or 
                use the new URL returned via the <literal>msg-create-nex</literal>t header.
            </para>

            <para>The advantage of this approach is that the client does not have to
                repost the message. It also only has to come up with a unique
                <literal>DUPLICATE_DETECTION_ID</literal> once.

            <para>By default, posted messages are not durable and will not be
                persisted in HornetQ's journal. You can create durable messages by
                modifying the default configuration as expressed in Chapter 2 so that
                all messages are persisted when sent. Alternatively, you can set a URL
                query parameter called <literal>durable</literal> to true when you post
                your messages to the URLs returned in the <literal>msg-create</literal>,
                <literal>msg-create-with-id</literal>, or <literal>msg-create-next</literal>

        <title>Consuming Messages via Pull</title>

        <para>There are two different ways to consume messages from a topic or
            queue. You can wait and have the messaging server push them to you, or you
            can continuously poll the server yourself to see if messages are
            available. This chapter discusses the latter. Consuming messages via a
            pull works almost identically for queues and topics with some minor, but
            important caveats. To start consuming you must create a consumer resource
            on the server that is dedicated to your client. Now, this pretty much
            breaks the stateless principle of REST, but after much prototyping, this
            is the best way to work most effectively with HornetQ through a REST
            interface.
        </para>

        <para>You create consumer resources by doing a simple POST to the URL
            published by the <literal>msg-pull-consumers</literal>
            response header if you are interacting with a queue, the
            <literal>msg-pull-subscribers</literal> response header if you're
            interacting with a topic. These headers are provided by the main queue or
            topic resource discussed in <link linkend="basics">HornetQ REST Interface
            Basics</link>. Doing an empty POST to one of these
            URLs will create a consumer resource that follows an auto-acknowledge
            protocol and, if you are interacting with a topic, creates a temporarily 
            subscription to the topic. If you want to use the acknowledgement protocol
            and/or create a durable subscription (topics only), then you must use the
            form parameters (<literal>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</literal>)
            described below.

                    the consumer for either the queue or topic, the response contained a
                    <literal>msg-consume-next</literal> response header. POST to the URL
                    contained within this header to consume the next message in the queue
                    or topic subscription. A successful POST causes the server to extract
                    a message from the queue or topic subscription, acknowledge it, and
                    return it to the consuming client. If there are no messages in the
                    queue or topic subscription, a 503 (Service Unavailable) HTTP code is
                    returned.

                    <para>For both successful and unsuccessful posts to the
                        msg-consume-next URL, the response will contain a new
                        msg-consume-next header. You must ALWAYS use this new URL returned
                        within the new msg-consume-next header to consume new
                        messages.

                <title>Recovering From Network Failures</title>

                <para>If you experience a network failure and do not know if your post
                    to a msg-consume-next URL was successful or not, just re-do your POST.
                    A POST to a msg-consume-next URL is idempotent, meaning that it will
                    return the same result if you execute on any one msg-consume-next URL
                    more than once. Behind the scenes, the consumer resource caches the
                    last consumed message so that if there is a message failure and you do
                    a re-post, the cached last message will be returned (along with a new
                    msg-consume-next URL). This is the reason why the protocol always
                    requires you to use the next new msg-consume-next URL returned with
                    each response. Information about what state the client is in is
                    embedded within the actual URL.

                <title>Recovering From Client or Server Crashes</title>

                <para>If the server crashes and you do a POST to the msg-consume-next
                    URL, the server will return a 412 (Preconditions Failed) response
                    code. This is telling you that the URL you are using is out of sync
                    with the server. The response will contain a new msg-consume-next
                    header to invoke on.
                </para>

                <para>If the client crashes there are multiple ways you can recover.
                    If you have remembered the last msg-consume-next link, you can just
                    re-POST to it. If you have remembered the consumer resource URL, you
                    can do a GET or HEAD request to obtain a new msg-consume-next URL. If
                    you have created a topic subscription using the name parameter
                    discussed earlier, you can re-create the consumer. Re-creation will
                    return a msg-consume-next URL you can use. If you cannot do any of
                    these things, you will have to create a new consumer.
                </para>

                <para>The problem with the auto-acknowledge protocol is that if the
                    client or server crashes, it is possible for you to skip messages. The
                    scenario would happen if the server crashes after auto-acknowledging a
                    message and before the client receives the message. If you want more
                    reliable messaging, then you must use the acknowledgement
                    protocol.

            <para>The manual acknowledgement protocol is similar to the auto-ack
                protocol except there is an additional round trip to the server to tell
                it that you have received the message and that the server can internally
                ack the message. Here is a list of the response headers you will be

                <para>After you have created a consumer resource, you are ready to

                    topic subscription, a 503 (Service Unavailable) HTTP code is returned.
                    A successful POST causes the server to extract a message from the

                            <literal>msg-consumer</literal> response header is returned. This
                            is a URL that points back to the consumer or subscription
                            resource. You will need that to clean up your connection after you
                            are finished using the queue or topic.

                    or
                    <literal>msg-acknowledgement</literal> URL was successful or not, just
                    re-do your POST. A POST to one of these URLs is idempotent, meaning
                    that it will return the same result if you re-post. Behind the scenes,
                    the consumer resource keeps track of its current state. If the last
                    action was a call to<literal>msg-acknowledge-next</literal>, it will
                    have the last message cached, so that if a re-post is done, it will
                    return the message again. Same goes with re-posting to
                    <literal>msg-acknowledgement</literal>. The server remembers its last
                    state and will return the same results. If you look at the URLs you'll
                    see that they contain information about the expected current state of
                    the server. This is how the server knows what the client is
                    expecting.

                    while you are doing a POST to<literal>msg-acknowledgement</literal>,
                    the server will return a 412 (Preconditions Failed) response code.
                    This is telling you that the URL you are using is out of sync with the
                    server and the message you are acknowledging was probably re-enqueued.
                    The response will contain a new <literal>msg-acknowledge-next</literal>
                    header to invoke on.
                </para>

                <para>As long as you have "bookmarked" the consumer resource URL
                    (returned from <literal>Location</literal> header on a create, or the
                    <literal>msg-consumer</literal> header), you can recover from client
                    crashes by doing a GET or HEAD request on the consumer resource to
                    obtain what state you are in. If the consumer resource is expecting
                    you to acknowledge a message, it will return a
                    <literal>msg-acknowledgement</literal> header in the response. If the

                    <literal>msg-acknowledge-next</literal> header will be in the
                    response. With manual acknowledgement you are pretty much guaranteed
                    to avoid skipped messages. For topic subscriptions that were created
                    with a name parameter, you do not have to "bookmark" the returned URL.
                    Instead, you can re-create the consumer resource with the same exact
                    name. The response will contain the same information as if you did a
                    GET or HEAD request on the consumer resource.

            <title>Blocking Pulls with Accept-Wait</title>

            <para>Unless your queue or topic has a high rate of message flowing
                though it, if you use the pull protocol, you're going to be receiving a
                lot of 503 responses as you continuously pull the server for new
                messages. To alleviate this problem, the HornetQ REST interface provides
                the <literal>Accept-Wait</literal> header. This is a generic HTTP
                request header that is a hint to the server for how long the client is
                willing to wait for a response from the server. The value of this header
                is the time in seconds the client is willing to block for. You would
                send this request header with your pull requests. Here's an
                example:
            </para>

            <programlisting>
POST /queues/jms.queue.bar/pull-consumers/consume-next-2

&lt;order>...&lt;/order></programlisting>

            <para>In this example, we're posting to a msg-consume-next URL and
                telling the server that we would be willing to block for 30

            <title>Clean Up Your Consumers!</title>

            <para>When the client is done with its consumer or topic subscription it
                should do an HTTP DELETE call on the consumer URL passed back from the
                Location header or the msg-consumer response header. The server will
                time out a consumer with the value of
                <literal>consumer-session-timeout-seconds</literal> configured from
                <link linkend="configuration">REST configuration</link>, so you
                don't have to clean up if you don't want to, but if you are a good kid,
                you will clean up your messes. A consumer timeout for durable
                subscriptions will not delete the underlying durable JMS subscription
                though, only the server-side consumer resource (and underlying JMS
                session).

        <title>Pushing Messages</title>

        <para>You can configure the HornetQ REST server to push messages to a
            registered URL either remotely through the REST interface, or by creating
            a pre-configured XML file for the HornetQ REST server to load at boot
            time.

        <section>
            <title>The Queue Push Subscription XML</title>

            <para>Creating a push consumer for a queue first involves creating a
                very simple XML document. This document tells the server if the push
                subscription should survive server reboots (is it durable). It must
                provide a URL to ship the forwarded message to. Finally, you have to
                provide authentication information if the final endpoint requires
                authentication. Here's a simple example:
            </para>

            <programlisting>
&lt;push-registration>
   &lt;durable>false&lt;/durable>
   &lt;selector>&lt;![CDATA[
   SomeAttribute > 1
   ]]&gt;
   &lt;/selector>
   &lt;link rel="push" href="http://somewhere.com" type="application/json" method="PUT"/>
   &lt;maxRetries>5&lt;/maxRetries>
   &lt;retryWaitMillis>1000&lt;/retryWaitMillis>
   &lt;disableOnFailure>true&lt;/disableOnFailure>
&lt;/push-registration></programlisting>

            <para>The <literal>durable</literal> element specifies whether the
                registration should be saved to disk so that if there is a server
                restart, the push subscription will still work. This element is not
                required. If left out it defaults to<literal>false</literal>. If
                durable is set to true, an XML file for the push subscription will be
                created within the directory specified by the
                <literal>queue-push-store-dir</literal> config variable defined in
                Chapter 2 (<literal>topic-push-store-dir</literal> for topics).
            </para>

            <para>The <literal>selector</literal> element is optional and defines a
                JMS message selector. You should enclose it within CDATA blocks as some
                of the selector characters are illegal XML.
            </para>

            <para>The <literal>maxRetries</literal> element specifies how many times
                a the server will try to push a message to a URL if there is a
                connection failure.
            </para>

            <para>The <literal>retryWaitMillis</literal> element specifies how long
                to wait before performing a retry.
            </para>

            <para>The
                <literal>disableOnFailure</literal> element, if set to true,
                will disable the registration if all retries have failed. It will not
                disable the connection on non-connection-failure issues (like a bad
                request for instance). In these cases, the dead letter queue logic of
                HornetQ will take over.
            </para>

            <para>The <literal>link</literal> element specifies the basis of the
                interaction. The <literal>href</literal> attribute contains the URL you
                want to interact with. It is the only required attribute. The
                <literal>type</literal> attribute specifies the content-type of what the
                push URL is expecting. The <literal>method</literal> attribute defines
                what HTTP method the server will use when it sends the message to the
                server. If it is not provided it defaults to POST. The
                <literal>rel</literal> attribute is very important and the value of it
                triggers different behavior. Here's the values a rel attribute can
                have:
            </para>

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>destination</literal>. The href URL is assumed to be a queue or topic resource of
                        another HornetQ REST server. The push registration will initially
                        do a HEAD request to this URL to obtain a msg-create-with-id
                        header. It will use this header to push new messages to the
                        HornetQ REST endpoint reliably. Here's an example:
                    </para>

                    <programlisting>
&lt;push-registration>
   &lt;link rel="destination" href="http://somewhere.com/queues/jms.queue.foo"/>

                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>template</literal>. In this case, the server is expecting the link element's
                        href attribute to be a URL expression. The URL expression must
                        have one and only one URL parameter within it. The server will use
                        a unique value to create the endpoint URL. Here's an
                        example:
                    </para>

                    <programlisting>
&lt;push-registration>
   &lt;link rel="template" href="http://somewhere.com/resources/{id}/messages" method="PUT"/>
&lt;/push-registration></programlisting>

                    <para>In this example, the {id} sub-string is the one and only one
                        URL parameter.

                <listitem>
                    <para><literal>user defined</literal>. If the rel attributes is not destination or template (or is
                        empty or missing), then the server will send an HTTP message to
                        the href URL using the HTTP method defined in the method
                        attribute. Here's an example:
                    </para>

                additional information you need to provide though. First, in the root
                element, you must define a unique id attribute. You must also define a
                destination element to specify the queue you should register a consumer
                with. For a topic, the destination element is the name of the
                subscription that will be created. For a topic, you must also specify the
                topic name within the topic element.

            <para>Push subscriptions only support BASIC and DIGEST authentication

            <para>For DIGEST, just replace basic-auth with digest-auth.</para>

            <para>For other authentication mechanisms, you can register headers you

        <title>Creating Destinations</title>

        <para>You can create a durable queue or topic through the REST interface.
            Currently you cannot create a temporary queue or topic. To create a queue
            you do a POST to the relative URL /queues with an XML representation of
            the queue. The XML syntax is the same queue syntax that you would specify
            in hornetq-jms.xml if you were creating a queue there. For example:
        </para>

        <programlisting>
POST /queues
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/hornetq.jms.queue+xml

&lt;queue name="testQueue">
   &lt;durable>true&lt;/durable>
&lt;/queue>

--- Response ---
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://example.com/queues/jms.queue.testQueue</programlisting>

        <para>Notice that the Content-Type is application/hornetq.jms.queue+xml.</para>

        <para>Here's what creating a topic would look like:</para>

        <programlisting>
POST /topics

            <para>Securing the HornetQ REST interface is very simple with the JBoss
                Application Server. You turn on authentication for all URLs within your
                WAR's web.xml, and let the user Principal to propagate to HornetQ. This
                only works if you are using the JBossSecurityManager with HornetQ. See
                the HornetQ documentation for more details.

        <title>Mixing JMS and REST</title>

        <para>The HornetQ REST interface supports mixing JMS and REST producers
            and consumers. You can send an ObjectMessage through a JMS Producer, and
            have a REST client consume it. You can have a REST client POST a message
            to a topic and have a JMS Consumer receive it. Some simple transformations
            are supported if you have the correct RESTEasy providers installed.
        </para>

        <section>
            <title>JMS Producers - REST Consumers</title>

            <para>If you have a JMS producer, the HornetQ REST interface only
                supports ObjectMessage type. If the JMS producer is aware that there may
                be REST consumers, it should set a JMS property to specify what
                Content-Type the Java object should be translated into by REST clients.
                The HornetQ REST server will use RESTEasy content handlers
                (MessageBodyReader/Writers) to transform the Java object to the type
                desired. Here's an example of a JMS producer setting the content type of
                the message.
            </para>

            <programlisting>
ObjectMessage message = session.createObjectMessage();
message.setStringProperty(org.hornetq.rest.HttpHeaderProperty.CONTENT_TYPE, "application/xml");</programlisting>

            <para>If the JMS producer does not set the content-type, then this
                information must be obtained from the REST consumer. If it is a pull
                consumer, then the REST client should send an Accept header with the
                desired media types it wants to convert the Java object into. If the
                REST client is a push registration, then the type attribute of the link
                element of the push registration should be set to the desired
                type.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>REST Producers - JMS Consumers</title>

            <para>If you have a REST client producing messages and a JMS consumer,
                HornetQ REST has a simple helper class for you to transform the HTTP
                body to a Java object. Here's some example code:
            </para>

            <programlisting>
public void onMessage(Message message)
{
   MyType obj = org.hornetq.rest.Jms.getEntity(message, MyType.class);
}</programlisting>

            <para>The way the <literal>getEntity()</literal> method works is that if
                the message is an ObjectMessage, it will try to extract the desired type
                from it like any other JMS message. If a REST producer sent the message,
                then the method uses RESTEasy to convert the HTTP body to the Java
                object you want. See the Javadoc of this class for more helper
                methods.
