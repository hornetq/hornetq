<!--
Bare bones stack with only UDP and UNICAST3. Multicast is unreliable
(members may get a multicast, or not) and messages don't get fragmented (if a message is
too big, it will be dropped). However, unicast messages (e.g. responses to multicast
messages) are reliable: they will be retransmitted if dropped. Since no membership protocol
is included, members have no way of finding other members. Such a functionality has to be
done on the application level in this case
